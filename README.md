# Splendor-Hotel-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project contains a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking data, visualized through a series of interactive dashboards. It examines booking trends, revenue patterns, customer behavior, and identifies opportunities for revenue optimization in the hospitality sector.

## Dashboard Components
### 1. Booking Trend Analysis

This dashboard tracks the hotel's booking and revenue patterns from 2014-2017, showing peak performance in 2016 (€12M revenue) followed by a 41.7% decline in 2017. Reveals cyclical booking patterns with significant revenue leakage (44.3%) and distinct lead time differences across distribution channels, with offline agents having the longest booking windows (160+ days) and corporate bookings the shortest (40-80 days).

### 2. Customer Behavior Analysis

This dashboard explores how deposit policies affect booking behavior and revenue generation. No-deposit bookings dominate revenue (84.5%) but cause 75% of cancellations, while refundable deposits show minimal cancellations but generate only 0.3% of revenue. Online travel agents drive 57.4% of revenue, with transient customers accounting for nearly half (48.3%) of all bookings through this channel.

### 3. Deposit Type Impact Analysis

This dashboard maps guest demographics and booking preferences, revealing Portugal as the dominant market (42.5% of guests), followed by UK (15%) and France (12.5%). Shows online travel agents commanding both the highest revenue share (57.4%) and daily rates (53.3% higher than offline agents), demonstrating their premium positioning in the distribution landscape.

### 4. Revenue Optimization Insights

This dashboard Identifies key revenue opportunities across markets and segments. The top five countries generate 40.9% of total revenue, with transient customers through corporate channels yielding the highest daily rates. Transient guests contribute 37.2% of revenue despite generating 48.3% of bookings, indicating potential for rate optimization in this segment.

## Key Insights
1. Channel Effectiveness: 
Online travel agents generate 57.4% of total revenue (€17M) while commanding 53.3% higher average daily rates than offline agents.
2. Deposit Policy Impact:
No-deposit bookings account for 84.5% of revenue (€25M) but represent 75% of all cancellations (30,000), suggesting a 44.3% revenue leakage (€13.12M) primarily from this segment.
3. Market Concentration: 
Portugal represents 42.5% of guest volume (85,000 guests) and 13.5% of revenue (€4M), with the top 5 countries generating 40.9% of total revenue.
4. Customer Segmentation: 
Transient guests drive 48.3% of bookings (58,000) and 37.2% of revenue (€11M), predominantly through online channels.
5. Seasonal Patterns: 
Peak booking periods in 2016 saw nearly 8,000 monthly bookings and €2M in monthly revenue, a 60% increase over 2015 figures.

## Business Recommendations
### 1. Optimize Deposit Policies: 
Implement targeted deposit requirements for high-risk booking periods to reduce the 44.3% revenue leakage, especially for the no-deposit segment that accounts for 75% of cancellations.
### 2. Channel Strategy: 
Invest in strengthening online travel agent relationships which deliver 57.4% of revenue while developing strategies to increase direct bookings (currently 15.2% of revenue) to improve margins.
### 3. Geographic Targeting: 
Focus marketing efforts on the top 5 countries (Portugal, UK, France, Germany, Spain) that generate 40.9% of revenue while developing targeted campaigns for the remaining markets that represent 59.1% of revenue opportunity.
### 4. Lead Time Management: 
- Implement dynamic pricing for bookings with:
  - 120+ days lead time (offline and online agent channels)
  - 40-80 days lead time (corporate channel)
  - Direct channel bookings (60-110 days)
### 5. Revenue Recovery: 
Develop strategies to recapture the €13.12M in revenue losses (44.3% of potential revenue), focusing specifically on the no-deposit booking segment that contributes to 75% of cancellations.
